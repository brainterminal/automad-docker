## Contributing

In case you are interested in contributing, you can help to grow a community, give feedback, report bugs or request features.    

However, I do not exclude at this point using parts of Automad's source in future projects under different licenses. In order to avoid having to ask anybody for permission when doing so, I will not accept any contributions to this repository. Please understand that pull requests will therefore be ignored.
